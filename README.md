### README for Solar Energy Prediction Project

#### Project Overview
Welcome to the Solar Energy Prediction Project, also known as "SolSight: Precision Predictions for Solar Efficiency." This project leverages machine learning (ML) techniques to predict solar power consumption, aiding companies in optimizing their energy usage and advancing sustainability goals. Through detailed Jupyter notebooks, we explore, analyze, and predict solar energy consumption using various factors such as weather conditions, operational data, and time metrics.

#### Getting Started

To dive into our analysis and models, follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine.

**Prerequisites:**
- Python 3.6 or later
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Relevant Python packages: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, keras, scikit-learn

Navigate through the directory structure in the Jupyter interface to open and run the notebooks. They are designed to be run sequentially:

1. `Model_Power_Consumption.ipynb` - For initial data loading, cleaning, and exploratory analysis.
2. `Predict_Power_Consumption.ipynb` - Contains the model building, training, and evaluation process.

#### Notebooks Summary

- **Data Preparation and Analysis**: This notebook guides you through the data preparation steps, including cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA), setting the stage for effective model development.
- **Model Development**: Focused on building and evaluating machine learning models to predict solar power consumption. This includes linear regression models and LSTM networks for time series forecasting.
