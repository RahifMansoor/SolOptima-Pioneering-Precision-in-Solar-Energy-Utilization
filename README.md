### README for Solar Energy Prediction Project

#### Project Overview
Welcome to the Solar Energy Prediction Project, also known as "SolSight: Precision Predictions for Solar Efficiency." This project leverages machine learning (ML) techniques to predict solar power consumption, aiding companies in optimizing their energy usage and advancing sustainability goals. Through detailed Jupyter notebooks, we explore, analyze, and predict solar energy consumption using various factors such as weather conditions, operational data, and time metrics.
